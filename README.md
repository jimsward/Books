#### Login

A user not yet logged in has read-only access. Unless you are logged in, any actions that would change the database are disabled.

The Sign Up page allows a potential user to receive an email with a randomly generated 8 character password.

#### Table of checkbook entries

The table starts with 40 rows - one per entries document - of check entries. Clicking on any row will spawn a dialog with all the fields for that document made editable.

#### Check Entry Form

This is where new checks are entered. Date, account, and an amount is required. The amount can be payment or a deposit but not both. The account must be in the accounts collection. Only logged in users can save an entry
