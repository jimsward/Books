<blockquote>About Stump3</blockquote>
 <p>First, the name. We live in western Sonoma County amongst the giant redwoods. Taking up most of our front yard is a stump about 30 feet in diameter at the ground.
  We have been told that it is the third largest stump in existence; could be. </p>
 <p>We are a small startup with the goal of producing a complete online accounting package via the MEAN stack.</p>
 <p>At this time we have a check register with complete CRUD operations and checkbook entry lookup by date, payee, account, and amount; customer pages create and modify customer
 records and transactions along with creating, printing, and manipulating invoices. Profit and Loss reports, both summary and detailed are available.</p>
